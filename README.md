Welcome to our Tiny Journal! Tiny Journal is the perfect applciation to capture the thoughts, memories, and ideas you'd rather nobody else be able to read. With our app, you can easily save your deepest darkest thoughts as encrypted files than can only be opened via the password protected app. We also include a "camo mode" (Ctrl + T), to quickly disguise your text from any prying eyes :)
As an avid journaler who has had the misfortune of having a journal read (as a wee lad!), this has been a bit of a passion project of mine. Right now it's pretty bare bones, but I plan to add many features, including "usb-key only" files, cloud storage, etc. Feel free to submit a pull request and add some features of your own! For those not interested in coding, an executable version will be available shortly.

THe base of this app is built using the AvalonEdit library.
